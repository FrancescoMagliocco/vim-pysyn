# vim-pysyn
Complete (WIP) Support for Python (Including version 3) Syntax in vim

This is a **Work In Progress**
I am very new to creating syntax files, so try to bare with me.  Yes the script is going to look very messy right now.
Yes it is going to have a lot of spelling mistakes, there will also be shit that doesn't even make sense and even more
shit that will cause errors if you try using this if you don't have my colorScheme.

This README is also going to look like shit as well and very bland, but this is just the beginning. I will add my
reasons as to why I have decided to create this and all of that shit.

If you want to help out, feel free too because there is a few things that I will need help with and I will post them
here in the README eventually.
